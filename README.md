This project is the code implementation of the meta-reinforcement learning algorithm TayMAML, written in Python. It utilizes TensorFlow v1.0 as the development framework and PyCharm as the code editor. The project comprises two main sections: a deep reinforcement learning algorithm and a meta-learning algorithm.

## 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm D3DQN-CAA

Purpose: Primarily designed to address the task scheduling problem in edge computing with a single task type.

### Main Code Components
- `agent.py`: Agent module
- `brain.py`: Brain module
- `D3DQN.py`: Implementation of the D3DQN algorithm
- `D3DQN_Run.py`: Script to run the D3DQN algorithm

## 2. Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithm TayMAML

Consists of two parts: the meta-learning algorithm and the reinforcement learning algorithm. The reinforcement learning algorithm used is D3DQN-CAA, while the meta-learning algorithm is TayMAML. It is mainly designed to tackle task scheduling problems in edge computing with task heterogeneity.

### Main Code Components
- `agent.py`: Agent module
- `brain.py`: Brain module
- `D3DQN.py`: Implementation of the D3DQN algorithm
- `TayMAML_Run.py`: Script to run the TayMAML algorithm
